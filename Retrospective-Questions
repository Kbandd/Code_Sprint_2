What went well this sprint?: 
The team successfully implemented user authentication using OAuth, which was a major component for our application's security. Most importantly, the backend API for data retrieval was developed and programmed ahead of schedule, allowing us more time for testing and refining.

What did not go well for this sprint?: 
As with all projects and codings, challenges were faced with the front-end development, such as those with integrating the API response into the ui. This took longer than anticipated and affected our overall progress.

Did you complete the tasks you planned to complete?: 
We completed most of the planned tasks but fell short on the front-end interface development and unit testing due to the challenges we faced.

Did you experience any unforeseen technical issues that prevented your progress? Please describe them.: 
Yes, integrating the backend API with the front-end was more complex than expected. The API required additional formatting and paraphrasing to fit the front-end requirements, leading to delays.

Do you feel you are on-track to complete your project? If no:
We are slightly behind schedule due to the front-end challenges.

How do you plan to change your development process, and why? 
We plan to give more time for front-end development and increase collaboration between back and front-end teams to make sure everything keeps going smoother with integration. Through all, we'll prioritize unit testing earlier in the development process to catch issues sooner.
